### 🕰 My (slightly chaotic) Timeline  

- **2020** → Learned how to code.  
  (Translation: Spent 3 hours debugging a missing `;`.)  

- **2021** → Started **Trace**.  
  Thought it was a startup.  
  Spoiler: it wasn’t. But I did learn *how to start a startup*.  

- **2022** → Built **Thintry**, an ad agency.  
  Completed **300+ projects**.  
  Basically survived on ☕ and deadlines.  

- **2023** → Rage quit Thintry.  
  Started **Grovix**, tried making an AI chatbot.  
  It was… let’s just say… dumber than a rock. 🪨🤖  

- **2024** → Invented **Veifeye**, an AI that fact-checks news.  
  Gov: “We’ll fund you.”  
  Me: “Great!”  
  Gov process: *loading…*  
  My wallet: 🪫  
  So yeah, I dropped it.  
  → Took a break: worked as **cleaner/cashier/dishwasher**.  
  (My most stable job so far 🧽💰🍽️).  

- **2025** → Plot twist!  
  - Co-founded **Lufta** (because sweets = happiness 🍫).  
  - Became part-time **Head of Ops** at Linkdify.  
  - Launched [bygrovix.com](https://bygrovix.com).  
  - Oh, and that **Veifeye funding**? Finally arrived… but the project was already in the grave 🪦.  
  - A close friend told me: *“Do one thing and stay consistent.”*  
    So I’m continuing **Lufta**, while contributing my skills to **Grovix**.  
  - Also started doing **live streams** on **YouTube & Kick** about coding, robotics, and electronics.
